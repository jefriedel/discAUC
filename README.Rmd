# discAUC

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.com/jefriedel/discAUC.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jefriedel/discAUC)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of discAUC is to provide a solution to easily calculate AUC for delay
discounting data. It includes logAUC and ordAUC as published in Borges et al. 
(2016). It also includes a solution for 0 delays for logAUC.

## Installation

You can install the released version of discAUC from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("discAUC")
```

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(discAUC)

#Calculate AUC for proportional indiference points for each outcome per subject.
AUC(dat = examp_DD,
    x_axis = "delay_months",
    indiff = "prop_indiff",
    amount = 1,
    groupings = c("subject","outcome"))
```
